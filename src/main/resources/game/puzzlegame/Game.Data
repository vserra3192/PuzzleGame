story
A standardized test has recently been developed
that is now used to determine the general effectiveness
of any form of A.I. (Artificial Intelligence). A series of
different A.I. systems, each named after a different
person in Ancient Greek history, has recently been scored
according to this test. Using only the clues below, match
each A.I. system to its test score, and determine the
institution that submitted it and the head of each team
that built it.
